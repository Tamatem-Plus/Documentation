        <span class="title">What is Tamatem ID?</span>
        <p class="textDescription">Tamatem ID is a user identity for the Tamatem player which provides two primary functions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="">Authentication: The process of verifying a Tamatem identity. This is typically achieved via an email or a mobile number and password.
                    This ensures that players are who they claim to be before granting them access to their accounts.
                </li>
                <li class="">Authorization: Once authenticated, the Tamatem platform then asks and determines what resources and data need to be accessed from
                    the playerâ€™s Tamatem ID account. This level of control is essential to maintain the security of user data, the integrity of the system, and
                    for the next steps through the integration.
                </li>
