        <p>Introduction:</p>
        <p class="textDescription">In games that store purchased items data in a server rather than the game client, there is a risk of the game client being tampered with, making requests to the game server claiming items never purchased, and injecting inaccuracy in-game server data, therefore it is recommended to do a verification over “inventory item redeem” action before altering stored data, and granting the item.</p>
        <p class="textDescription">This verification happens in a game server-to-platform server communication, or in a platform server webhook to the game server upon each package purchase.</p>
